# MNIST DIGIT Classification

Overview

This project implements a neural network model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit (0-9). The goal is to train a model that accurately predicts the digit in each image.

# Project Structure





File: MNIST_project.ipynb



Language: Python



Libraries Used:





TensorFlow (tensorflow)



Keras (tensorflow.keras)



NumPy (numpy)



Pandas (pandas)



Matplotlib (matplotlib)



Seaborn (seaborn)

# Dataset

The MNIST dataset is loaded directly from tensorflow.keras.datasets.mnist. It includes:





Training Set: 60,000 images (x_train) with corresponding labels (y_train).



Test Set: 10,000 images (x_test) with corresponding labels (y_test).



Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale array, and labels are integers from 0 to 9.

# Model Training

The model was trained for 10 epochs with the following configuration:





Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy



Optimizer: Likely Adam (based on common practice, not explicitly specified in the notebook)



Validation: Performed on the 10,000 test images


# Observations





The model achieved 97%+ validation accuracy by Epoch 2, indicating fast learning.



After Epoch 5, validation accuracy plateaued, suggesting potential slight overfitting.



# Recommendations:





Implement early stopping to halt training when validation accuracy stops improving.



Add dropout layers to regularize the model and reduce overfitting.

# Model Performance


A confusion matrix was generated to analyze predictions on the test set. Key insights include:

High Accuracy Classes





Digit 0: 976 correct predictions, minimal misclassifications.



Digit 1: ~99.3% accuracy (1127 correct out of ~1135).


# Common Confusions





Digit 2: Occasionally misclassified as 3, 7, or 8 (e.g., 13 images misclassified as 7).



Digit 4: Sometimes confused with 9 (17 misclassifications).



Digit 6: Minor confusion with 5 (10 misclassifications).



Digit 7: Slight confusion with 1 and 9.



These errors are expected due to visual similarities in handwritten digits.


# Model Strengths





Excellent at recognizing distinct digits (0, 1, 3).



Low training loss and high overall accuracy.



Good generalization on the test set despite minor misclassifications.
